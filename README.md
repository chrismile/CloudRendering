## Building and running the program

### Linux

There are four ways to build the program on Linux systems.
- Using the system package manager to install all dependencies (tested: apt on Ubuntu, pacman on Arch Linux, dnf/yum on Fedora).
- Using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install all dependencies (by using the flag `./build.sh --vcpkg`).
- Using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to install all dependencies (by using the flag `./build.sh --conda`).
- Using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to install all dependencies (by invoking `./build.sh` after calling `nix-shell`).

The script `build.sh` in the project root directory can be used to build the project. If no arguments are passed, the
dependencies are installed using the system package manager. When calling the script as `./build.sh --vcpkg`, vcpkg is
used instead. The build scripts will also launch the program after successfully building it. If you wish to build the
program manually, instructions can be found in the directory `docs/compilation`.

Below, more information concerning different Linux distributions tested can be found.

#### Arch Linux

Arch Linux and its derivative Manjaro are fully supported using both build modes (package manager and vcpkg).

The Vulkan SDK will be automatically installed using the package manager `pacman` when using the scripts.

#### Ubuntu

Ubuntu >= 20.04 is fully supported.

The Vulkan SDK will be automatically installed using the official PPA.

Please note that Ubuntu 18.04 is only partially supported. It ships an old version of CMake, which causes the build
process using vcpkg to fail if not updating CMake manually beforehand. Also, an old version of GLEW in the package
sources causes the Vulkan interoperability support in sgl to be disabled regardless of whether the Vulkan SDK is
installed if the system packages are used.

#### Other Linux Distributions

If you are using a different Linux distribution and face difficulties when building the program, please feel free to
open a [bug report](https://github.com/chrismile/CloudRendering/issues).


### Windows

There are two ways to build the program on Windows.
- Using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install all dependencies. The program can then be compiled using
  [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
- Using [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) to install all dependencies and compile the program using MinGW.

In the project folder, a script called `build-msvc.bat` can be found automating this build process using vcpkg and
Visual Studio. It is recommended to run the script using the `Developer PowerShell for VS 2022` (or VS 2019 depending on
your Visual Studio version). The build script will also launch the program after successfully building it.
Building the program is regularly tested on Windows 10 and 11 with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and 2022.
The flag `--devel` can be used to generate a working Visual Studio `.sln` project in the `.build` folder.

Please note that the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) needs to be installed before starting the
build process.

The script `build.sh` in the project root directory can also be used to alternatively build the program using
MSYS2/MinGW on Windows. For this, it should be run from a MSYS2 shell.

If you wish to build the program manually using Visual Studio and vcpkg, or using MSYS2, instructions can be found in
the directory `docs/compilation`.


### macOS

There are two ways to build the program on macOS.
- Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the dependencies and compile the program using LLVM/Clang (recommended).
- Using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install the dependencies and compile the program using
  LLVM/Clang.

The script `build.sh` in the project root directory can be used to build the program either using Homebrew when
supplying no additional arguments, or using vcpkg when calling the script as `./build.sh --vcpkg`.
As macOS does not natively support Vulkan, MoltenVK, a Vulkan wrapper based on Apple's Metal API, is utilized.
Installing it via the scripts requires admin rights. MoltenVK can also be installed manually from
[the website](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#mac).

Notes:
- I rented Apple hardware for a few days once for testing that running the program works on macOS.
  As I do not regularly have access to a real system running macOS, it is only tested that the program can compile in a
  CI pipeline build script on an x86_64 macOS virtual machine provided by GitHub Actions. So please note that it is not
  guaranteed that the program will continue working correctly on macOS indefinitely due to the lack of regular testing.
- To enable high DPI support, the program needs to be run from an app bundle. This happens automatically when the script
  `build.sh` has finished building the program. Please note that the app bundle only contains the Info.plist
  file necessary for high DPI support and is currently not yet redistributable. If you want to help with improving the
  macOS app bundle support for this project by contributing development time, please feel free to contact me.


### Unit Tests

Unit tests using the [GoogleTest framework](https://github.com/google/googletest) can be built by passing the argument
`-DUSE_GTEST=On` to CMake.
These unit tests can also be run using software rendering via [SwiftShader](https://github.com/google/swiftshader).


### PyTorch Module

A [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) module can be built by passing `-DBUILD_PYTORCH_MODULE=On` to CMake.

It provides functions such as `initialize`, `cleanup` and `render_frame` and works both with CPU tensors and CUDA tensors.
To be able to use CUDA tensors, the dependency sgl must have been built using CUDA interoperability support (this should
happen automatically when CUDA is detected on the system during the build process).
An example of how to use the PyTorch module can be found here: https://github.com/chrismile/vpt_denoise

The path to where the module should be installed can be specified using `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/dir`.
If TorchLib does not lie on a standard path, the directory where the CMake config files of TorchLib lie must be
specified using, e.g.:

```
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/miniconda3/envs/vpt/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/share/cmake
```

When using the script `build.sh` on Unix systems, the following command can be used to build the program with PyTorch
support and to install the Python module:

```shell
./build.sh --use-pytorch --install-dir /path/to/dir
```

If a Conda or pip environment is active, the build script will automatically set the necessary paths to PyTorch.
Since July 2024, PyTorch no longer needs to be compiled using the C++11 ABI if the `build.sh` script is used.
It will automatically detect the way in which PyTorch was built and adapt the way in which CMake is invoked.
This means that the pre-compiled packages from the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) can be used.
Internally, the command `python -c "import torch; print(torch._C._GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI)"` is used to check with which
C++ ABI PyTorch was built. For information on how PyTorch can be built manually with the C++11 ABI, please refer to
[pytorch.md](docs/compilation/pytorch.md).

NOTE: On Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.9 installed via Conda, a problem one user noticed was that GLIBCXX_3.4.30 was
used for building the PyTorch module using the system libstdc++, but the Conda libstdc++ did not support GLIBCXX_3.4.30.
The problem could be fixed by installing a newer version of libstdc++ in the Conda environment using the commands below.

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge libgcc-ng libstdcxx-ng
```

It is planned to also add support for the PyTorch Vulkan backend once the PyTorch Vulkan code base has sufficiently
matured. As of 2022-02-14, there are still some problems building PyTorch with Vulkan support on x86_64 Linux.


## How to add new data sets

Under `Data/CloudDataSets/datasets.json`, loadable data sets can be specified. Additionally, the user can also open
arbitrary data sets using a file explorer via "File > Open Dataset..." (or using Ctrl+O).

Below, an example for a `Data/CloudDataSets/datasets.json` file can be found.

```json
{
    "datasets": [
        { "name" : "Sphere (64x64x64)", "filename": "sphere_64x64x64.xyz" },
        { "name" : "Bunny", "filename": "bunny.nvdb" }
    ]
}
```

These files then appear with their specified name in the menu "File > Datasets". All paths must be specified relative to
the folder `Data/CloudDataSets/` (unless they are global, like `C:/path/file.dat` or `/path/file.dat`).

Supported formats currently are:
- .xyz files, which consist of a header of 3x uint32 (grid size sx, sy, sz) and 3x double (voxel size vx, vy, vz)
  followed by sx * sy * sz floating point values storing the density values stored in the dense Cartesian grid.
- .vdb and .nvdb files using the [OpenVDB](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb) and
  [NanoVDB](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb/tree/master/nanovdb/nanovdb) formats,
  which store sparse voxel grids. For OpenVDB support, the flag `--use-openvdb` needs to be passed to the build script.
- .dat/.raw and .mhd/.raw files, which store density grids with metadata in arbitrary precision.
  For more details see: src/CloudData.cpp, CloudData::loadFromDatRawFile and CloudData::loadFromMhdRawFile.
